- We've successfully built our app and tested on our localhost i.e. PORT = 5000//8080//8080//etc. 

- Our "requirements.txt" and "Dockerfile" are updated (consists of necessary: uvicorn//gunicorn//python-multipart//etc.)

                                        PROJECTFLOW i.e. (Render Deployment flow): 

1. Go to Render Dashboard and Sign in/Sign up >> go through EMAIL verification >>  entered into My Workspace.

2. Go to "+ New" button and click >> select "Web Services".

3.a. When connecting github the very first time;
  -  Add either all your repos by giving permission or select a particular repository from github to actively work on.

3.b. During initial connection, if you've allowed only one repo and later want to access another repo as a new project;
  - select "Public Git Repository" and provide the corresponding repo's link.

4. Next step is to click on "Connect" >> Name your Web Service.

5. Choose "Docker" as language >> let the "main" Branch be as it is >> no compulsion in picking a "Region".

8. Provide the environmental variable-credentials i.e {AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} & {AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}

9. Lastly, click on "Deploy Web Services". 

- Now, we wait for the entire process to unfold and see through the log msgs on our screen.

- on successful deployment the sign changes from "building" to "live" and we can click on the % LINK % 
  provided {below the Name of our Web Service} to see our project live on render.com
