ðŸ”¹ First and foremost - In case of errors in Deployment:

- read through the logs.
- copy and paste it to gpt or any other llm to simplify problem and then solution.
- most probably the errors are to do with either ;

a. requirements.txt : necessary modules/ packages not mentioned such as uvicorn//gunicorn//etc.
b. dockerfile       : image not built right in accordance with the web-app we've used.

:
Now looking how this point (b) is important ;
- The CMD in your Dockerfile changes depending on whether you're using FastAPI or Flask.
- Since FastAPI is an ASGI framework, you need "uvicorn", which is designed to handle ASGI apps.
- Since Flask is a WSGI framework, it works better with "gunicorn".

note: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) and WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) are server interfaces 
that define how a web framework communicates with a web server.   For further info read documentation.

ðŸ”¹ In Render Dashboard >> "Projects" section provides an overview of all the projects we're or we've worked on.
"Ungrouped Services" in this overview section shows all our services:

a. Active(maybe successfully deployed or failed deploy )
b. Suspended
c. All




ðŸ”¹ On Clicking any of Service Names from the "Ungrouped Services" >> we're led to another interface that informs 
us about the Initiation of this deployment action and it's current state i.e. Active//Suspended//Fail Deploy,
these come under the category called "Events" for that particular web service.

- and on clicking on "Settings" >> we can modify changes such as Name/ Region/ Instance Type and moreover,
we can choose to "Suspend Web Service" or even "Delete Web Service" permanently after verifying.
